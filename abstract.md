# Abstract

Recent statistics show that 75% of applicants are filtered out from applicant pools for a position by the Applicant Tracking System due to the inflexibility of machines in understanding different resume formats and wordings. The gloomy scenery of the job market in general, adding to the inclining competitiveness in the tech job market makes it much harder for candidates to successfully land their dream job. Thus, it is important to examine and form a tool that can assist new graduates, the most vulnerable individuals in the job market, to elevate their employment prospects. Lander is a text-mining-based tool that helps the student increase their chance of passing the initial resume screening round by optimizing their resume using a keyword-suggesting system. Moreover, Lander will also match a candidate to a compatible job by matching the experience in their resume to a job description, and in return, increase the chance of getting accepted into the job.

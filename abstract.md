# Abstract

Recent statistics showed that 75% of applicants nowadays are filtered out from applicant pools for a position by Applicant Tracking System, due to the inflexibility of machines in understanding differemt resume formats and synonyms. Lander is a text-mining based tool that helps the student increase their chance of passing the initial resume screening round by optimizing their resume using a keyword-suggesting system. Moreover, Lander will also match a candidate to a compatible job by matching the experiences in their resume to a job description, and in return, increase the chance of getting accepted into such job.

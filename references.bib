The dilemma in the case is whether the company should opt for automation or not. And if the company is adopting automation to support workforce planning and recruitment functions, is the company ready for the same. The HR industry at large is aware of the challenges faced by the recruitment teams in terms of the various hiring functions involving sales engine, sourcing, interviewing, providing offers, post offer follow-ups and finally joining and induction. To address this challenge, the case touches on instituting a culture change by embracing technology into divisions which are not yet open to adopting innovative methods. The company is looking at incorporating Artificial Intelligence in its various processes. It is also looking at Robot Process Automation to perform standard HR functions in the recruitment process. The company must decide whether to implement automation and if it does, how it should be executed. The case also debates on whether technology would increase the effectiveness of talent acquisition function and bring a change in the administrative HR image or would this automation-led hiring take away the control from the company human resources?},

@article{laumer2015,
	abstract = {This research focuses on the effects of different business process management components in combination with information technology on recruiting process performance. The results of a study of Germany's largest 1,000 business enterprises (response rate 13.1 {\%}) reveal that business process analysis, business process improvement and the usage of applicant tracking systems reduce recruiting process costs. Specifically, the cycle time of the recruiting process can be shortened significantly through business process controlling and process analysis, and by using an applicant tracking system that supports the design and evaluation of key performance indicators. Business process standardization combined with applicant tracking systems and business process documentation as well these systems used together with business process controlling have a significant positive impact on stakeholder satisfaction with the recruiting process. The general quality of the process can be improved through business process controlling as well as through a combination of applicant tracking systems and business process controlling. Our results reveal that several components of the business process management in conjunction with a supporting applicant tracking system have differing impacts on recruiting process performance. This paper discusses these diverse effects of business process management on process performance and draws implications for information systems success research.},
